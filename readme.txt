The ZoomifyWP Free plugin for WordPress offers an easy way to embed Zoomify into your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Make any image zoomable no matter how large. The ZoomifyWP Free plugin for WordPress offers an easy way to embed Zoomify files into your WordPress site. To use you must upload the folder created by the Zoomify converter to your wp-content/uploads/zooms directory via FTP. If the zooms directory does not exist, you must add it. You can then embed a shortcode [zoomify filename="myCoolZoom"] to your post or page. 

Zoomify Free includes everything you need to create amazing and interactive zooms of images with a simple three-step zoom process. Download the version for your platform at http://www.zoomify.com/free.htm

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I include more than one Zoomify image per page =

Not at this time. Future versions will include methods to specifically name the element id and therefore allow you to add as many zooms on a page or post as is feasible.

= Can I upload a ZIF =

Zifs are special files created by the Zoomify Converter. As of this writing, the free converter didn't have a production version capable of creating the ZIF but a version was in beta testing. ZIF upload capability will be available in future versions.

= Can I add skins to the zoom =

Not at this time. The free version of the Zoomify product contains a very basic user interface. Future versions of the ZoomifyWP plugin will include the specification of basic skins as well as other skins you have created.

= Can I apply styling to the Zoomify div =

Yes. The styling of the block is basic and ready for further styling such as width, height, border color, etc.
